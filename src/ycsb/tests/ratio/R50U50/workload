#   This set of workload is to compare the impact of read and update ratio on tail latency.
#   Three types of workload distributions: 5-95, 25-75, 50-50, 75-25, 95-5
#   The following are set as constant                     
#   Work load distribution: uniform
#   Default data size: 1 KB records (10 fields, 100 bytes each, plus key)
#   Number of records is 10k
#   Number of operation is 10k
